This is a submission for assignment 2 for Natural Language Processing course at JADS.

This assignment works on a topic modeling task. The goal of the task is to gain insights into the content of a corpus of news articles on Nvidia.

In this submission the follwoing files are attached:
- `A2-14.ipynb` Jupyer notebook file with the source code for the assignment
- `A2-14.pdf` PDF file that consists of report for the assignment
- `BERT.ipynb` Jupyter notebook with experiments for Bert model
- `FLSA-W.ipynb` Jupyter notebook with experiments for FLSA-W model
- `LDA.ipynb` Jupyter notebook with experiments for LDA model
- `Experiments with FLSA-W.ipynb` Jupyter notebook with experiments for FLSA-W model
- `README.md`
- `filtered_corpus.csv` filtered corpus used for running the experiments 
- `lda_visualization.html` html where topics from LDA model are visualized  
- `requirements.txt` required Python packages to run the code

How to run the source code:
Open the IDE of your choice, such as VScode, or JupyterLab. 
It is recommended that you set up a virtual environment. This could be done with the following command: 'python -m venv .venv'. Python version for this assignment is 3.12.4.
