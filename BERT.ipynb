Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets  Stocks recently featured in the blog include  NVIDIA Corporation   NASDAQ NVDA    Xilinx  Inc    NASDAQ XLNX    Lattice Semiconductor Corp    NASDAQ LSCC   and KLA Tencor Corporation   NASDAQ KLAC   Here are highlights from Friday s Analyst Blog  Chipmakers on Fire  3 Under the Radar Stocks to WinAfter a torrid 2018  chipmakers bounced back this year  Chip stocks collectively notched their best start to a year  boosting investors  sentiment amid lingering global growth concerns  The VanEck Vectors Semiconductor  a fund that mostly tracks semiconductor stocks  has soared more than 20  since the beginning of this year  the best first quarter performance since the fund s inception in 2000  The fund easily outperformed the broader S P 500 S 12  rally so far this year  Chipmakers  in fact  have posted gains in 10 out of the last 12 weeks Trade dispute between United States and China along with worries about China s economic well being affected a few of the semiconductor industry bigwigs  Weak iPhone sales along with deceleration in cryptocurrency mining ventures further raised questions about weakening demand for chips  But  investors saw promising trends in the semiconductor industry this year  which eventually helped chip stocks climb more than 30  since the recent low touched on Dec 26  2018 The Fed s patient stance with interest rate hikes has bolstered high flyers in the industry  After all  rising rates do affect these stocks as investors adjust to a new environment By the way  chipmakers have become more realistic about growth trends  The industry has recognized a glut of chips in the market and it s time to curb production  And that s exactly what Micron  NASDAQ MU  CEO Sanjay Mehrotra acknowledged and pledged to cut 5  of chip production  This lifted Micron s shares 9 6  to  43 99 on Mar 21  after touching an intraday high of  44 21  Largely  the PHLX Semiconductor Index increased 3 5  and closed at 1 441 83  just short of its record of 1 445 90 set on Mar 12 To top it  NVIDIA Corporation s  6 8 billion bid to acquire Israeli chipmaker Mellanox helped renew investors  faith on the beaten down sector  If the deal is sealed  it would be Nvidia s biggest and will also strengthen its hold in the growing data center market As a matter of fact  it s the data center market that first and foremost boosted chip stocks this year  Adding to the optimism is an array of new technological trends like 5G wireless  artificial intelligence  self driving cars and the Internet of Things Some investors are seeing even more positives for these semiconductor stocks  citing consumer are on a solid footing  especially  in the United States  Consumer confidence bounced back in February on a healthy labor market and an end to the U S  government s longest shutdown in history  Consumers  assessment of current conditions improved and expectations about the future strengthened  indicating sturdy economic growth 3 Semiconductor Stocks to GainThanks to the aforesaid bullish trends  chip heavyweights will surely garner
